#Model-View-Controller pattern

# Introduction #

MVC discussion


# Details #

I'd like to see us change and use the MVC pattern for this project. Some of the code will be the view (in the current case, the 3D visual) some will be the model (the data structures that hold the information) and the controller that responds to inputs and makes the model and view active.
