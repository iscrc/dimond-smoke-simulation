Independent study project

The original idea was given at this site and their 2D implementation:

Project Goals (these may take years BTW)

  * 00.0 develop java modeling tools via LIFE
  * 01.0 model the [Euler inviscid equations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inviscid_flow) in 3D
  * 02.0 develop environments that sustain short (a 'few' turnover times) statistical patterns
  * 03.0 develop environments that sustain structures for long periods
  * 04.0 develop environments that allow patterns to 'absorb' loose patterns (robust patterns) without collapse
